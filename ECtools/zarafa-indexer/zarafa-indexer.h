 *
 * @par Searching
 *	Currently three different commands are supported by the zarafa-indexer:
 *	- PROPS \n
 *		This will return a list of all property id's which are being indexed
 *		for each message. This command does not accept any additional arguments.
 *		The format of this returned list is: \n
 *			- OK: <name> <propid>; <name> <propid>;...
 *			.
 *	- SCOPE \n
 *		This is used to limit the scope where to search for the messages. It
 *		is mandatory to call SCOPE before QUERY with at least a restriction
 *		on the store. Optionally the scope can be restricted to folders as well.
 *		The format for providing the scope is: \n
 *			- SCOPE: <storeentryid>; <folderentryid>; <folderentryid>;...
 *			.
 *		The reply will always indicate success or failure in which case the
 *		error message will be provided as part of the returned string.
 *	- QUERY \n
 *		This is used to send the CLucene query to be executed. This command
 *		only takes a single argument which is the CLucene query string.
 *		The format for the command is: \n
 *			- QUERY: <CLucene query>
 *			.
 *		If the query was executed correctly the result will be: \n
 *			- OK: <messageentryid> <score>; <messageentryid> <score>;...
 *			.
 *		if the query provided no results, the return code will be 'OK:',
 *		only when the query itself failed will an error code be returned.
