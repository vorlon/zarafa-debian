# Stubbing messages requires a multi-server environment

# Specify what action should be taken on archive messages whose primary message
# has been deleted. The options are 'store' and 'delete', meaning store the
# archived message in a special 'Deleted' folder or delete the archived messages
# respectively.
# Default: store
cleanup_action	=	store

# Specify if items that are cleaned up from the archive are at least the age
# that is specified in the purge_after setting. This is to avoid messages 
# being deleted from the archive when they where deleted from the primary
# store by a delete operation.
# Note that setting to yes, will cause a cleanup run to seemingly do nothing.
# A rule of thumb is to set this to the same value as delete_enable. So when
# delete_enable is set to yes, make sure cleanup_follow_purge_after is also
# set to yes.
# Default: no

# to match the attached archives to the requested state as specified in LDAP or
