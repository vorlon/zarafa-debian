/**
 * Compares two ICSCHANGE objects and determines which of the two should precede the other.
 * This function is supposed to be used as the predicate in std::stable_sort.
 *
 * The rules for determining if a certain change should precede another are as follows:
 * - Users take precendence over Groups and Companies.
 * - Groups take precedence over Companies only.
 * - Companies never take precedence.
 * - If the changes are of the same type, precedence is determined by comparing the binary
 *   values using SortCompareABEntryID. If the compare returns less than 0, the left change
 *   should take precedence, otherwise it shouldn't. Note that that doesn't imply that the right
 *   change takes precedence.
 *
 * For the ICS system it is only important to group the users, groups and companies. But for the
 * dupliacte change filter it is necessary to group changes for a single object as well. Hence the
 * 4th rule.
 *
 * @param[in]	left
 *					An ICSCHANGE structure who's sSourceKey is interpreted as an ABEID stucture. It is compared to
 *					the right parameter.
 * @param[in]	right
 *					An ICSCHANGE structure who's sSourceKey is interpreted as an ABEID stucture. It is compared to
 *					the left parameter.
