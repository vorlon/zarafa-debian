 *                          expect [A-B). This offset makes sure GetSerializedObject can be called with an index from the expected
 *                          range.
 * @param[in]	ulCount		The number message streams that should be handled. The actual amount of streams returned from the server
 *                          could be less if those messages didn't exist anymore on the server. This makes sure the client can still
 *                          request those streams and an appropriate error can be returned.
 * @param[in]	streams		The streams (or actually the information about the streams).
 * @param[in]	lpTransport	Pointer to the parent transport. Used to get the streams from the network and unlock soap when done.
 * @param[out]	lppStreamExporter	The new instance.
