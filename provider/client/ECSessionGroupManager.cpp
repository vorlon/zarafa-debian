 * Threading comment:
 *
 * This function is safe since we hold the sessiongroup list lock, and we AddRef() the object before releasing the sessiongroup list
 * lock. This means that any Release can run at any time; if a release on the sessiongroup happens during the running of this function,
 * we are simply upping the refcount by 1, possibly leaving the refcount at 1 (the release in the other thread leaving the refcount at 0, does nothing)
 *
 * The object cannot be destroyed during the function since the deletion is done in DeleteSessionGroupDataIfOrphan requires the same lock
 * and that is the only place the object can be deleted.
