 * The table manager is responsible for opening tables, and providing
 * access to open tables by a handle ID for each table, and updating tables when
 * a change is made to the underlying data and sending notifications to clients
 * which require table update notifications.
 *
 * Each session has its own table manager. This could be optimised in the future
 * by having one large table manager, with each table having multiple cursors for
 * each user that has the table open. This would save memory on overlapping tables
 * (probably resulting in around 30% less memory usage for the server).
