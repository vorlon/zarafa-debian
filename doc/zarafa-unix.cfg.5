.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBunix\&.cfg\fR

The
\fIunix\&.cfg\fR
is a configuration file for the unix user plugin\&. All options to correctly retrieve user and group information can be set here\&.

.PP
The file consists of one big section, but parameters can be grouped by functionality\&.
.PP
The parameters are written in the form:
.PP
\fBname\fR
=
\fIvalue\fR
.PP
The file is line\-based\&. Each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, nothing, a parameter or a directive\&. A line beginning with `#\' is considered a comment, and will be ignored by Zarafa\&. Parameter names are case sensitive\&. Lines beginning with `!\' are directives\&.
.PP

.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF EACH PARAMETER"
.PP
\fBfullname_charset\fR
.RS 4
The charset that is used in /etc/passwd for the fullname of a user\&. In most setups, us\-ascii is used, but may also be iso\-8859\-15\&. All charsets supported by the system iconv() are supported here\&. Since iso\-8859\-15 is an extension on us\-ascii, this is used as the default to support high characters for most latin languages\&. If your default shell is in UTF\-8 (see your locales settings), enter utf\-8 here\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIiso\-8859\-15\fR
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
\fBmin_user_uid\fR

.RE
.PP
\fBmax_user_uid\fR
