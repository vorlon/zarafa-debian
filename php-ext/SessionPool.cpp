#include "SessionPool.h"

/*
 * How the session pooling works
 * =============================
 *
 * Basically, we have a list of active sessions. Each active session (Session object)
 * contains a 'tag' (an identifier referring to, say, the name of a profile), and
 * a valid IMAPISession pointer.
 *
 * When a new session is created (int main.cpp through the mapi_logon_* functions), a new
 * session object is created and added to the pool. The SessionPool class manages these 
 * sessions and controls their lifetime. Basic lifetime rules:
 *
 * - A Session can never die while it is being used in a running page request (ie ulRef > 0)
 * - Multiple threads *can* use the same session object (ie ulRef > 1)
 * - When too many sessions are active, we kill an unused session (ie ulRef == 0)
 * - When too many sessions are active and they are *all* locked (this would mean that there would
 *   be N simultaneous page requests, each of them using a different session object, where N
 *   is our maximum session count), we add an extra session anyway (instead of waiting for a
 *   session slot to come free)
 *
 * The SessionPool object is thread-safe:
 * - All actions are mutex-locked (and will never take very long!)
 *
